    /// ## Triangle Size and Validity
    ///
    /// If a surface is curved along both axes, the triangle's size is chosen
    /// such, that it approximates the surface, with the maximum allowed
    /// deviation of the actual surface defined by the provided tolerance
    /// argument.
    ///
    /// Otherwise, the size of the returned triangle is at least partially
    /// arbitrary. Take the extreme case of a plane: Since it is not curved at
    /// all, the returned triangle can be arbitrarily large.
    ///
    /// However, since surfaces are infinite, and we can't represent infinite
    /// triangles, there is no sensible upper bound for the size. Instead, to
    /// prevent an arbitrary choice for the size of triangles, which would imply
    /// properties of the surface that are not true, and might therefore be
    /// confusing, the triangles returned by this function have a length of zero
    /// along axes that do not require approximation.
    ///
    /// The most extreme case would be a plane, for which the returned triangle
    /// is collapsed to a point. For a cylinder, the triangle would have the
    /// appropriate width to approximate the curved axis given the provided
    /// tolerance, while having zero height.
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Note
    ///
    /// At the time this was written, there was no dedicated type to represent
    /// barycentric coordinates. Nor any other code that used them, I think.
    ///
    /// If this changes, and a special type for barycentric coordinates is
    /// added, it would make sense to return that here.
