        // That we're transforming the vertex geometry here, instead of down in

        // transform code would need the half-edge's end vertex, and we would
        // need to pass the curve into the vertex transform code).
        //
        // Doing it here is easier. It might be a hack, but so be it. I have two
        // reasons for accepting this, instead of doing it "the right way" (if

        // thing to do):

        // - At some point, it will no longer be necessary to define vertex
        //   geometry redundantly in every local curve space. Then this whole
        //   situation will be easier to handle.
        // - With geometry living in a separate layer now, it's unclear if the
        //   current approach to transforms is the right one anyway. So far,
        //   we're still creating new topological objects with each
        //   transformation, but whether this is desirable is not obvious.
        //
        // When we have progress on those two points, whatever the "right way"
        // is will have changed anyway, so I'm not too worried about a hack here
        // or there.
