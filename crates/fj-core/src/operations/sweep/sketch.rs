    ///
    /// The above requirement is a bit draconian. It would be much nicer, if
    /// this operation just worked, regardless of the relation of `path` and
    /// `surface`, and in fact, a previous version of it did.
    ///
    /// However, this previous version also made some undocumented assumption
    /// that didn't hold in the general case. It was also getting in the way of
    /// introducing the new geometry system.
    ///
    /// The decision was made that, for now, simplifying this operation and
    /// putting more requirements on the caller, was the right call. Once the
    /// new geometry system is in place, we'll hopefully be in a position to
    /// improve the sweep operation substantially.
