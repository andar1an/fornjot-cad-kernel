//! # Fornjot Math Library
//!
//! [Fornjot] is an early-stage b-rep CAD kernel written in Rust. The kernel is
//! split into multiple libraries that can be used semi-independently, and this
//! is one of those.
//!
//! This library provides basic math types for Fornjot. It is built on
//! [nalgebra] and [Parry], but provides an interface that is specifically
//! tailored to the needs of Fornjot.
//!
//!
//! ## Failing [`From`]/[`Into`] implementations
//!
//! Please note that any [`From`]/[`Into`] implementation that convert floating
//! point numbers into [`Scalar`] can panic. These conversions call
//! [`Scalar::from_f64`] internally and panic under the same conditions. This
//! affects [`Scalar`] itself, but also any other types in this crate that
//! provide conversions from types that involve `f64`.
//!
//! This explicitly goes against the mandate of [`From`]/[`Into`], whose
//! documentation states that implementations must not fail. This is a
//! deliberate design decision. The intended use case of `Scalar` is math code
//! that considers NaN results a bug, not a recoverable error.
//!
//! For this use case, having easy conversions available is an advantage, and
//! explicit `unwrap`/`expect` calls would add nothing. In addition, the
//! [`From`]/[`Into`] documentation fails to provide any reasons for its
//! mandate.
