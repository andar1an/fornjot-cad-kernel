/// The bivector representation chosen here, two vectors whose outer product
/// forms the bivector, is not the only one, and it might not be the best one
/// for our needs.
///
/// I considered using a coordinate-based representation, as that would be
/// unique and require less memory, but since we need 3 coordinates for 3D, but
/// just 1 coordinate for 2D, this would require type shenanigans or the (at the
/// time of writing) unstable `generic_const_exprs` feature.
///
/// I've decided that two vectors is good enough, and anything else not worth
/// the trouble. But we might want to reconsider, once `generic_const_exprs` is
/// stable.
