# Fornjot - Experiments

Sometimes I need to try something that has a good chance of not working out. If I do that, I sometimes don't want to be encumbered by existing code. And I don't want to have the responsibility of cleaning up after myself; which I would have to do, if an experiment in the actual Fornjot code were to fail.

This is what the experiments in this directory are for. They provide this unencumbered playground.

I generally try to document what an experiment is for and how it went, but I might not do that until after it's done.
