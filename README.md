## About

Fornjot is an **early-stage CAD kernel**, using **boundary representation (b-rep)**, written in the Rust programming language.

As a CAD kernel, the project's main goal is to provide **a solid foundation for developers to build on top of**, whether for special purpose tooling, third-party libraries for extending Fornjot's feature set, or full-featured CAD applications.

In doing so, Fornjot follows these principles:

- Focus on **mechanical CAD applications**, like 3D printing, machining, woodworking; over other use cases such as architecture or electronics.
- Favor **reliability over features**. Anything you can do should either work as expected, or result in a clear and actionable error.
- Maintain **a friendly API for directly defining models** in Rust. This means code-first CAD modeling (or Code-CAD) is natively supported.
- Support **code-first CAD modeling in other languages**, by enabling third-party APIs.

Fornjot is still in development and doesn't always live up to these ambitions. None the less, these are the priorities the project follows.

## Status

Fornjot is usable for simple models (see [`models/` directory](models)), but currently lacks the features for anything more advanced. Work to change that is underway.

Despite this, there are some experimental projects that are build on top of Fornjot:

- [CommandCAD](https://github.com/IamTheCarl/CommandCAD)
- [`fj-text`](https://github.com/samgoldman/fj-text)
- [`bevy_mod_fornjot`](https://github.com/TotalKrill/bevy_mod_fornjot)


## Overview

Fornjot features a modular architecture, allowing you to pick and choose which parts of it you want to use. It is made up of the following libraries:

- [`fj`]: All-in-one API that re-exports all of the following crates.
- [`fj-math`]: Math primitives used by the rest of Fornjot.
- [`fj-interop`]: Basic types that allow other crates to interoperate, without depending on each other.
- [`fj-core`]: Core primitives and code operating on those primitives.
- [`fj-export`]: Exports Fornjot models to external data formats.
- [`fj-viewer`]: Displays Fornjot models.
- [`fj-window`]: Simple windowing abstraction for use with `fj-viewer`.

## Usage

Fornjot is a set of Rust libraries (see list above). The definitive documentation on how to use those is their reference documentation. The `crates.io` pages of each library (see list above) link to those.

If you want to use Fornjot to create a specific model in Rust, the best starting point are the [example models](models/) in this repository:

- To display a model, run `cargo run -p cuboid` (replace `cuboid` with name of model you want to display).
- To export a model, run `cargo run -p cuboid -- --export model.3mf` (replace `cuboid` with name of model you want to export; optionally replace `3mf` with another supported file format).
- To see full set of CLI options, run `cargo run -p cuboid -- --help` (all models have the same CLI interface, so this shouldn't differ much between them).
